One person&#x27;s
experience at one particular time (Labor Day weekend, 2023).</p><p>I was on the island for 3 days, arriving at Kahului airport Friday at 9pm and
leaving Monday on a redeye Monday at 11pm. It centered around the road to Hana,
camping, hiking, and sunrise at the summit of Haleakala.</p><p>I rented a convertible for 3 days, <code>$148</code> declining additional coverage, picked
up some groceries that would survive without refrigeration, <code>$67</code> (fruit,
carrots, trail mix, bagels, Clif bars, pistachios) and got a
bunk in a shared room at the Howzit hostel, <code>$71</code> to crash and wake up early.
They have a minimum age of 12 to stay there and it&#x27;s basic, but friendly,
reasonable, and with free chocolate chip pancakes in the morning.</p><p>Before I went, I got <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Maui-Revealed-Guidebook-Andrew-Doughty/dp/1949678180" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maui Revealed</a> by Andrew Doughty <img loading="lazy" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tpMNwlIhL._SY466_.jpg" alt="Maui Revealed" class="img_ev3q">
and highlighted some potential places to pull over on the way. This book is a
must for the road to Hana, because it calls out exact distances from mile
markers for stops along the way. Many are unmarked trails to low-traffic
waterfalls you can hike to, such as a hunters&#x27; road called Wailua Iki leading here:
<img loading="lazy" alt="Wailua Iki 1" src="/writing/assets/images/02-cbb682c4c657f9982e3307c27653bdbe.jpeg" width="723" height="1280" class="img_ev3q">
<img loading="lazy" alt="Wailua Iki 2" src="/writing/assets/images/04-6474b844935086a61aea6dd16251c76d.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q">
Yes you can swim in this one; there are no signs discouraging it.</p><p>I woke up when the pancakes started, and got onto the
<a href="https://www.recreation.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recreation.gov</a> app a little before 7am to reserve
my spot for Haleakala sunrise Sunday. It fills up fast, so be ready to
nab a spot right at 7am two days before you plan to go.</p><p>I&#x27;ll mention packing now. I took one frameless backpacking backpack and one
regular backpack. I included:</p><ul><li>1-person tent</li><li>20 degree sleeping bag, which was even a little too warm</li><li>sleeping pad</li><li>inflatable pillow</li><li>clothes</li><li>bathing suit, towel, snorkel</li><li>hiking boots</li><li>binoculars</li><li>empty 3L Camelbak, which I filled up at the airport after landing</li></ul><p>After pancakes and booking Haleakala in the app, I started my drive to Hana.
I&#x27;d recommend starting early. I was on the road by 8. Take your time and drive
slowly, enjoying the winding road through paradise. With a convertible,
the open view is wonderful.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="3 Bears" src="/writing/assets/images/3-bears-f5ec4bec66fa2b37feca8745821f02dd.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q">
Use the book along the way, and pick out your next stop before you leave the
previous, noting mile marker instructions, parking, and helpful notes. Some
waterfalls, like 3 Bears above, have local signs requesting no swimming
where the falls are considered sacred. Here, I chose to get this close on land
but not swim.
To get down here, I had to climb down a chain anchored in rock on the mountain
side of the road next to the bridge and scramble down and over slippery rocks.
I did slip once here and bruise my hand catching myself, getting some slightly
painful fine prickly hairs from a plant in my skin in the process.</p><p>Here, and many places, there are things that can kill or
injure you. Make your own decision for you and those you&#x27;re with, and be a good
neighbor to native Hawaiians. There are plenty of places to swim, including
waterfalls, that aren&#x27;t considered sacred (but some can still kill you).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Trailside flower1" src="/writing/assets/images/05-d9257d62c031af39552e7f1b7f076cfa.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q">

Exotic flowers are everywhere, just keep you eyes open on trails.

food along the way but not much, and they are not always open. But I did stop
for a large smoothie,d <code>$17</code>! of local fruits at Hana Harvest that I will call
worth it. Note that USDA checkpoints won&#x27;t let you take fruit to the mainland
US, so enjoy it while you&#x27;re here.</p><p>My last big stop was Waianapanapa park, which has a lovely black sand beach.
You have to get a timed reservation online ahead of time, <code>$15</code>, and bring it with
you. This is a great time to jump around in--and get knocked down by--the waves.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Waianapanapa cave" src="/writing/assets/images/08-28af2421c17a61d4c2c3c79adc530a8c.jpeg" width="960" height="1280" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Waianapanapa blowhole" src="/writing/assets/images/09-92fb2b883767f70f1846635b314391d3.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q">
Blowholes occur where the ocean undercuts the shore. Stay back and live.
This one is along the trail I hiked east from Waianapanapa. When I left it
was hot and sunny, and 30 minutes later, it was warm and pouring rain.</p><p>It was nearing sunset when I left Waianapanapa, so I got to Kipahulu
campground, where I&#x27;d reserved a campsite on the Recreation.gov app <code>$8</code>
and a National Park fee of <code>$30</code> is additionally taken on site, unless
you have a National Parks pass. There are pit toilets, but no showers.
Bring hand sanitizer.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Kipahulu sunrise" src="/writing/assets/images/kipahulu-sunrise-e4b66b6bb20ad36100ead7ded7a40e42.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q">
Wake up early and watch the sun rise over the ocean, and check out the Big
Island. Again, I did a simple grocery breakfast since there&#x27;s nothing around
and I didn&#x27;t want to worry about cooking.
<img loading="lazy" alt="Coconuts" src="/writing/assets/images/coconuts-1b113e0c4dc41455fa8d26088e66b5d1.jpeg" width="960" height="1280" class="img_ev3q">
The USDA let me take one of these coconuts home on the plane.</p><p>You don&#x27;t have to leave the national park to visit Ohe&#x27;o Gulch.
<img loading="lazy" alt="Ohe&amp;#39;o Gulch" src="/writing/assets/images/oheo-9f1d75236956bf3e469de8fc5057b588.jpeg" width="960" height="1280" class="img_ev3q"> There are beautiful views on a short
hike/walk, but you can&#x27;t swim here.</p><p>From here, you can hike the Piwaiwai trail starting near Ohe&#x27;o Gulch.

The trail ends abruptly with a big sign warning of flash floods, falling rocks,
and fines. Some people take a side trail around it just before the sign. If
you do, stay away from the waterfall and rock walls. Rocks do come over the edge
of cliffs.</p><p>Past Kipahulu there&#x27;s a church whose road is easy to miss (see the book) where
Charles Lindbergh is buried, connected to a park overlooking the ocean.
<img loading="lazy" alt="Church" src="/writing/assets/images/17-cf5c5bfa28ef7e6fcbd07cc2ebed9a22.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q">

<img loading="lazy" alt="Alelele" src="/writing/assets/images/19-1ba4cb773a250134a8433a84879e1f98.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q">
Alelele falls is illegal to hike to and there are highly-warranted signs about
falling rocks. People ignored them, jumped around wire fencing and handed
babies down to family members. I hiked in and stayed away from cliffs along the
valley, and when I got to the pool beneath the waterfall, I went in, but stayed
well clear of the sides. I was by myself at this point, and while in the water,
a large rock slammed into the water ten feet from me. I didn&#x27;t even know it was
falling until it hit. As I was putting on my shoes, I warned a family with a
baby and some teenagers about it, but they went in anyway, near the cliffs.
The family with the baby ended up swimming right where the rock had landed, so
I let them know that not fifteen minutes beforehand the rock had landed right
there, big enough to kill a person, and they got out. Moral: don&#x27;t follow
anyone else; make your own judgments.</p><p>Alelele is the farthest I went clockwise around East Maui. You can keep going
into the arid southwest, which is interesting, but I&#x27;ve done it before, and
wanted to go back the same way, hit a couple spots I missed the previous day,
and have fun driving the curves.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Laulima Farms" src="/writing/assets/images/fruit-fa1015f49e792bc705b2995e38903c3d.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q">
Laulima Farms had a great fruit plate (grown there) and coffee</p><p>I then stopped at the Venus Pool for some cliff jumping into the brackish pool.
<img loading="lazy" alt="Venus Pool" src="/writing/assets/images/20-1ddce2cf409a134af2048e09efa9cedf.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q">
I had to park a ways up the road. The path is on the north side of the bridge.
The final path down to the pool requires some sure footing.</p><p>I did most of my meals this second full day from groceries again, except for
a chili lunch for <code>$10</code> from a local. While I drove
slowly on the road <em>to</em> Hana, on the way back, I had fun zipping along in the
convertible. Whenever I got behind someone, I&#x27;d pull over and let some distance
accumulate, get back on the road before anyone passed me, and have some more
road to myself. Since it was the late afternoon, few cars were coming the other
direction toward Hana.</p><p>I&#x27;d found a basic campsite on the Hipcamp app, <code>$34</code>. It was a place to set up
a tent and a port-a-potty, and was tricky to find in the rural roads east of
Kahului. But it was the closest campsite I could find to Haleakala. I woke up
before 3am, quickly took down my tent, and was on the road. Make sure you have
enough gas to drive up and down a mountain the afternoon before.</p><p>It takes a little longer than Google Maps tells you to get to the summit.
Bring your National Park pass or receipt from Kipahulu campground (it&#x27;s the
same national park) and your reservation in the Recreation.gov app. Also bring
warm clothes and blankets. It&#x27;s frigid up there. I arrived over an hour before
sunrise, got into my sleeping bag inside the car, put down the convertible top,
and looked at stars and the moon in the crystal clear skies from 10,000 feet.</p><p>At the summit, sunrise is earlier than your phone tells you, since you can see
around the curve of the earth a bit. There is small building at the summit you
can&#x27;t enter, but has a small amount of space to sit or stand, depending on how
many people get up there before you. I got there just early enough to find one
spot to sit on a wall and wrap my sleeping bag around me. Don&#x27;t underestimate
how cold it is up there.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Haleakala sunrise" src="/writing/assets/images/21-438ce710e8a015abf28c73a4cf3a709e.jpeg" width="1280" height="960" class="img_ev3q">

If the mountain is socked in by clouds, all the more beautiful, because you&#x27;re
above those clouds.

at the summit, not open to the public. It&#x27;s one of the best places on the
earth&#x27;s surface to have a telescope because of the altitude and clean air.
Looking west, you see the West Maui. Lahaina, sadly destroyed by fire, is on
its other side
<img loading="lazy" alt="Haleakala sunrise" src="/writing/assets/images/24-acc7f1378e7b62d9fbe48239c45fc341.jpeg" width="1280" height="617" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On your way down, there are two overlooks worth stopping at: Kalahaku and
Leleiwi, with some short hikes. You can see into the &quot;crater&quot; which is
due to erosion rather than volcanic activity, but with numerous volcanic
mounds inside, atop this enormous mountain.
