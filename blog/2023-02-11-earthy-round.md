Before songs of joy or hopes or fears<br/>
Were sent to meet the grains of air,<br/>
And tales of courage pricked the ears<br/>
Of budding heroes under worried care,<br/>

I held my gifts for those unknown<br/>
To angels searching yawning space<br/>
Who pondered what might still be sown<br/>
In such a wild and violent place.<br/>

My habitat ends not perceived<br/>
For creatures of another kind,<br/>
I veiled my purpose interleaved<br/>
In creativity divine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

And when the time for those had come<br/>
Whose mirrored countenance gave light<br/>
To creatures, never wearisome<br/>
Of purest love and strongest might,<br/>

I welcomed them with all I stored<br/>
Through ages known to none of late.<br/>
I gave all that I could afford<br/>
To them who worried naught of fate,<br/>

Until they grasped for other good<br/>
Than freely given from the dust.<br/>
They never could have understood<br/>
That wisdom’s knowledge hides in trust.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

My destiny was shaper of<br/>
That seedling grove of royalty<br/>
Till they, beloved, maturely love<br/>
And humbly join in shaping me.<br/>

But they trampled on my glory!<br/>
I’m cursed despite obedience!<br/>
My lot is now to groan and be<br/>
Receiv’r of blood of innocents.<br/>

But pity not, you hearers, lest<br/>
You feign discerning sisterhood<br/>
With me. Your span lags mine at best<br/>
By seven orders’ magnitude.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

My birth was shrouded–ere I was<br/>
Forged in the fires of Theia’s blow–<br/>
From all my guests alive because<br/>
That tumult seeded Luna’s glow.<br/>

She danced around my molten lathe<br/>
Until my surface cooled enough<br/>
For her to daily doubly bathe<br/>
My rocky coasts, which start out rough.<br/>

I’ve overseen the rise and fall<br/>
Of aeon-spanning dynasties.<br/>
Let words be few, if spoke at all<br/>
And listen: You are just a breeze.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Yet still I give my fruits on limb<br/>
Though fraught with toil and labored pain<br/>
I’m patient, yet I long for him<br/>
To make me fully new again,<br/>

When heaven’s song will me restore,<br/>
Inoculated with the sound<br/>
Of wavelengths latent in my core<br/>
And yours, when what is lost is found,<br/>

And dissonance resolves in your<br/>
Redemption and in mine, and each<br/>
Of us rejoice: Exalted poor<br/>
Have reconciled grasp and reach!<br/>
