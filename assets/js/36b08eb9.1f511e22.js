One person\'s\\nexperience at one particular time (Labor Day weekend, 2023).\\n\\nI was on the island for 3 days, arriving at Kahului airport Friday at 9pm and\\nleaving Monday on a redeye Monday at 11pm. It centered around the road to Hana,\\ncamping, hiking, and sunrise at the summit of Haleakala.\\n\\nI rented a convertible for 3 days, `$148` declining additional coverage, picked\\nup some groceries that would survive without refrigeration, `$67` (fruit,\\ncarrots, trail mix, bagels, Clif bars, pistachios) and got a\\nbunk in a shared room at the Howzit hostel, `$71` to crash and wake up early.\\nThey have a minimum age of 12 to stay there and it\'s basic, but friendly,\\nreasonable, and with free chocolate chip pancakes in the morning.\\n\\nBefore I went, I got [Maui Revealed](https://www.amazon.com/Maui-Revealed-Guidebook-Andrew-Doughty/dp/1949678180) by Andrew Doughty ![Maui Revealed](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71tpMNwlIhL._SY466_.jpg)\\nand highlighted some potential places to pull over on the way. This book is a\\nmust for the road to Hana, because it calls out exact distances from mile\\nmarkers for stops along the way. Many are unmarked trails to low-traffic\\nwaterfalls you can hike to, such as a hunters\' road called Wailua Iki leading here:\\n![Wailua Iki 1](/img/maui-2023/02.jpeg)\\n![Wailua Iki 2](/img/maui-2023/04.jpeg)\\nYes you can swim in this one; there are no signs discouraging it.\\n\\nI woke up when the pancakes started, and got onto the\\n[Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov) app a little before 7am to reserve\\nmy spot for Haleakala sunrise Sunday. It fills up fast, so be ready to\\nnab a spot right at 7am two days before you plan to go.\\n\\nI\'ll mention packing now. I took one frameless backpacking backpack and one\\nregular backpack. I included:\\n\\n- 1-person tent\\n- 20 degree sleeping bag, which was even a little too warm\\n- sleeping pad\\n- inflatable pillow\\n- clothes\\n- bathing suit, towel, snorkel\\n- hiking boots\\n- binoculars\\n- empty 3L Camelbak, which I filled up at the airport after landing\\n\\nAfter pancakes and booking Haleakala in the app, I started my drive to Hana.\\nI\'d recommend starting early. I was on the road by 8. Take your time and drive\\nslowly, enjoying the winding road through paradise. With a convertible,\\nthe open view is wonderful.\\n\\n![3 Bears](/img/maui-2023/3-bears.jpeg)\\nUse the book along the way, and pick out your next stop before you leave the\\nprevious, noting mile marker instructions, parking, and helpful notes. Some\\nwaterfalls, like 3 Bears above, have local signs requesting no swimming\\nwhere the falls are considered sacred. Here, I chose to get this close on land\\nbut not swim.\\nTo get down here, I had to climb down a chain anchored in rock on the mountain\\nside of the road next to the bridge and scramble down and over slippery rocks.\\nI did slip once here and bruise my hand catching myself, getting some slightly\\npainful fine prickly hairs from a plant in my skin in the process.\\n\\nHere, and many places, there are things that can kill or\\ninjure you. Make your own decision for you and those you\'re with, and be a good\\nneighbor to native Hawaiians. There are plenty of places to swim, including\\nwaterfalls, that aren\'t considered sacred (but some can still kill you).\\n\\n![Trailside flower1](/img/maui-2023/05.jpeg)\\n![Trailside flower 2](/img/maui-2023/06.jpeg)\\nExotic flowers are everywhere, just keep you eyes open on trails.\\n![Trailside flower 3](/img/maui-2023/07.jpeg)\\n![Trailside flower 4](/img/maui-2023/13.jpeg)\\n\\nMy lunch and dinner were simple, from my groceries. There are some places for\\nfood along the way but not much, and they are not always open. But I did stop\\nfor a large smoothie, `$17`! of local fruits at Hana Harvest that I will call\\nworth it. Note that USDA checkpoints won\'t let you take fruit to the mainland\\nUS, so enjoy it while you\'re here.\\n\\nMy last big stop was Waianapanapa park, which has a lovely black sand beach.\\nYou have to get a timed reservation online ahead of time, `$15`, and bring it with\\nyou. This is a great time to jump around in--and get knocked down by--the waves.\\n\\n![Waianapanapa cave](/img/maui-2023/08.jpeg)\\n\\n![Waianapanapa blowhole](/img/maui-2023/09.jpeg)\\nBlowholes occur where the ocean undercuts the shore. Stay back and live.\\nThis one is along the trail I hiked east from Waianapanapa. When I left it\\nwas hot and sunny, and 30 minutes later, it was warm and pouring rain.\\n\\nIt was nearing sunset when I left Waianapanapa, so I got to Kipahulu\\ncampground, where I\'d reserved a campsite on the Recreation.gov app `$8`\\nand a National Park fee of `$30` is additionally taken on site, unless\\nyou have a National Parks pass. There are pit toilets, but no showers.\\nBring hand sanitizer.\\n\\n![Kipahulu sunrise](/img/maui-2023/kipahulu-sunrise.jpeg)\\nWake up early and watch the sun rise over the ocean, and check out the Big\\nIsland. Again, I did a simple grocery breakfast since there\'s nothing around\\nand I didn\'t want to worry about cooking.\\n![Coconuts](/img/maui-2023/coconuts.jpeg)\\nThe USDA let me take one of these coconuts home on the plane.\\n\\nYou don\'t have to leave the national park to visit Ohe\'o Gulch.\\n![Ohe\'o Gulch](/img/maui-2023/oheo.jpeg) There are beautiful views on a short\\nhike/walk, but you can\'t swim here.\\n\\nFrom here, you can hike the Piwaiwai trail starting near Ohe\'o Gulch.\\n![Piwaiwai](/img/maui-2023/11.jpeg)\\n![Piwaiwai](/img/maui-2023/12.jpeg)\\n![Piwaiwai](/img/maui-2023/14.jpeg)\\n![Piwaiwai](/img/maui-2023/15.jpeg)\\n![Piwaiwai](/img/maui-2023/bamboo.jpeg)\\n![Piwaiwai](/img/maui-2023/16.jpeg)\\nThe trail ends abruptly with a big sign warning of flash floods, falling rocks,\\nand fines. Some people take a side trail around it just before the sign. If\\nyou do, stay away from the waterfall and rock walls. Rocks do come over the edge\\nof cliffs.\\n\\nPast Kipahulu there\'s a church whose road is easy to miss (see the book) where\\nCharles Lindbergh is buried, connected to a park overlooking the ocean.\\n![Church](/img/maui-2023/17.jpeg)\\n![Church](/img/maui-2023/18.jpeg)\\n\\nPast here, roads have some narrow spots and blind curves around cliffs.\\n![Alelele](/img/maui-2023/19.jpeg)\\nAlelele falls is illegal to hike to and there are highly-warranted signs about\\nfalling rocks. People ignored them, jumped around wire fencing and handed\\nbabies down to family members. I hiked in and stayed away from cliffs along the\\nvalley, and when I got to the pool beneath the waterfall, I went in, but stayed\\nwell clear of the sides. I was by myself at this point, and while in the water,\\na large rock slammed into the water ten feet from me. I didn\'t even know it was\\nfalling until it hit. As I was putting on my shoes, I warned a family with a\\nbaby and some teenagers about it, but they went in anyway, near the cliffs.\\nThe family with the baby ended up swimming right where the rock had landed, so\\nI let them know that not fifteen minutes beforehand the rock had landed right\\nthere, big enough to kill a person, and they got out. Don\'t follow\\nanyone else; make your own judgments.\\n\\nAlelele is the farthest I went clockwise around East Maui. You can keep going\\ninto the arid southwest, which is interesting, but I\'ve done it before, and\\nwanted to go back the same way, hit a couple spots I missed the previous day,\\nand have fun driving the curves.\\n\\n![Laulima Farms](/img/maui-2023/fruit.jpeg)\\nLaulima Farms had a great fruit plate (grown there) and coffee\\n\\nI then stopped at the Venus Pool for some cliff jumping into the brackish pool.\\n![Venus Pool](/img/maui-2023/20.jpeg)\\nI had to park a ways up the road. The path is on the north side of the bridge.\\nThe final path down to the pool requires some sure footing.\\n\\nI did most of my meals this second full day from groceries again, except for\\na chili lunch for `$10` from a local. While I drove\\nslowly on the road _to_ Hana, on the way back, I had fun zipping along in the\\nconvertible. Whenever I got behind someone, I\'d pull over and let some distance\\naccumulate, get back on the road before anyone passed me, and have some more\\nroad to myself. Since it was the late afternoon, few cars were coming the other\\ndirection toward Hana.\\n\\nI\'d found a basic campsite on the Hipcamp app, `$34`. It was a place to set up\\na tent and a port-a-potty, and was tricky to find in the rural roads east of\\nKahului. But it was the closest campsite I could find to Haleakala. I woke up\\nbefore 3am, quickly took down my tent, and was on the road. Make sure you have\\nenough gas to drive up and down a mountain the afternoon before.\\n\\nIt takes a little longer than Google Maps tells you to get to the summit.\\nBring your National Park pass or receipt from Kipahulu campground (it\'s the\\nsame national park) and your reservation in the Recreation.gov app. Also bring\\nwarm clothes and blankets. It\'s frigid up there. I arrived over an hour before\\nsunrise, got into my sleeping bag inside the car, put down the convertible top,\\nand looked at stars and the moon in the crystal clear skies from 10,000 feet.\\n\\nAt the summit, sunrise is earlier than your phone tells you, since you can see\\naround the curve of the earth a bit. There is small building at the summit you\\ncan\'t enter, but has a small amount of space to sit or stand, depending on how\\nmany people get up there before you. I got there just early enough to find one\\nspot to sit on a wall and wrap my sleeping bag around me. Don\'t underestimate\\nhow cold it is up there.\\n\\n![Haleakala sunrise](/img/maui-2023/21.jpeg)\\n![Haleakala sunrise](/img/maui-2023/22.jpeg)\\nIf the mountain is socked in by clouds, all the more beautiful, because you\'re\\nabove those clouds.\\n![Haleakala sunrise](/img/maui-2023/25.jpeg)\\n\\nSunrise is totally worth the early morning and cold. An observatory is also\\nat the summit, not open to the public. It\'s one of the best places on the\\nearth\'s surface to have a telescope because of the altitude and clean air.\\nLooking west, you see the West Maui. Lahaina, sadly destroyed by fire, is on\\nits other side\\n![Haleakala sunrise](/img/maui-2023/24.jpeg)\\n\\nOn your way down, there are two overlooks worth stopping at: Kalahaku and\\nLeleiwi, with some short hikes. You can see into the \\"crater\\" which is\\ndue to erosion rather than volcanic activity, but with numerous volcanic\\nmounds inside, atop this enormous mountain.\\n![Haleakala sunrise](/img/maui-2023/23.jpeg)\\n\\nI made my way down the mountain and headed toward Kihei and South Maui.\\nLunch at Saltwater deli, `$24`, and snorkeling off the south side of\\nPalauea Beach (free). I had my own full-face snorkel but didn\'t want to\\npay the exorbitant flipper rentals from the stand at the Four Seasons.\\nThere are probably reasonable places to rent, but I just went without.\\n![Snorkeling](/img/maui-2023/26.jpeg)\\n![Snorkeling](/img/maui-2023/27.jpeg)\\n![Snorkeling](/img/maui-2023/28.jpeg)\\n\\nDinner at Monkeypod, `$50`, and a final sunset at the beach, before heading\\nback to the airport.\\n![Snorkeling](/img/maui-2023/sunset.jpeg)\\n\\nAside from flights, all my costs for these three days were around `$525`,\\nincluding food, lodging, entrance fees, car rental, and gas, but not including\\ngear I own."},{"id":"earthy-round","metadata":{"permalink":"/writing/blog/earthy-round","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-11-earthy-round.md","title":"An Earthy Round","description":"Before songs of joy or hopes or fears","date":"2023-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 11, 2023","tags":[{"label":"writing","permalink":"/writing/blog/tags/writing"}],"readingTime":1.83,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Liechty","url":"https://github.com/adamliechty","image_url":"https://github.com/adamliechty.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/adamliechty.png"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"earthy-round","title":"An Earthy Round","authors":{"name":"Adam Liechty","url":"https://github.com/adamliechty","image_url":"https://github.com/adamliechty.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/adamliechty.png"},"tags":["writing"]},"prevItem":{"title":"East Maui 2023","permalink":"/writing/blog/maui-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Gardener","permalink":"/writing/blog/gardener"}},"content":"Before songs of joy or hopes or fears<br/>\\nWere sent to meet the grains of air,<br/>\\nAnd tales of courage pricked the ears<br/>\\nOf budding heroes under worried care,<br/>\\n\\nI held my gifts for those unknown<br/>\\nTo angels searching yawning space<br/>\\nWho pondered what might still be sown<br/>\\nIn such a wild and violent place.<br/>\\n\\nMy habitat ends not perceived<br/>\\nFor creatures of another kind,<br/>\\nI veiled my purpose interleaved<br/>\\nIn creativity divine.<br/>\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n\\nAnd when the time for those had come<br/>\\nWhose mirrored countenance gave light<br/>\\nTo creatures, never wearisome<br/>\\nOf purest love and strongest might,<br/>\\n\\nI welcomed them with all I stored<br/>\\nThrough ages known to none of late.<br/>\\nI gave all that I could afford<br/>\\nTo them who worried naught of fate,<br/>\\n\\nUntil they grasped for other good<br/>\\nThan freely given from the dust.<br/>\\nThey never could have understood<br/>\\nThat wisdom\u2019s knowledge hides in trust.<br/>\\n<br/>\\n<br/>\\n\\nMy destiny was shaper of<br/>\\nThat seedling grove of royalty<br/>\\nTill they, beloved, maturely love<br/>\\nAnd humbly join in shaping me.<br/>\\n\\nBut they trampled on my glory!<br/>\\nI\u2019m cursed despite obedience!<br/>\\nMy lot is now to groan and be<br/>\\nReceiv\u2019r of blood of innocents.<br/>\\n\\nBut pity not, you hearers, lest<br/>\\nYou feign discerning sisterhood<br/>\\nWith me.

She pushed a heavy wheelbarrow along full of watering cans, stopping to care for each of her plants in that space. Some had arrived in the meadow as seeds borne on the wind, and some she planted herself, but she loved them all. As she stopped at each one, she would gently pour the water over its petals and sing to it the love, beauty, and truth of the heavens, and each would drink up all of these, receiving her gifts and thriving as a result. The flowers absorbed the water and breathed the common air that wafted gently and graciously through the field, and they built their bodies with all of these and the sweet songs that made them even more beautiful. The gardener loved each of her plants, and could not remember any time before she had loved them or the day when she had started caring for them.\\n\\nNow the meadow was vast, and as the years went by, the gardener called more and more plants her own, bringing them under her care. One day, she came upon a new plant, but it had not yet bloomed. She gently poured water on it and sang to it the love, beauty, and truth of the heavens. But the water seemed to run off the sides of its body and onto the ground. The next day, she returned and repeated her ritual, but still the water did not penetrate its body, and she observed that it had a thick outer skin. She returned each day for some weeks, hoping that her love and life-giving water would be received and that this plant would grow and blossom.\\n\\nBut weeks turned into months, and the gardener grew more discouraged. In desperation one day, she peeled back some of the rough skin from the plant and poured water into its side, but it still did not seem to take. She sang to it, but with not quite the same belief as before. She was too distraught to return to it for several days, but when she did, she brought even more water, but still it ran down onto the ground. In despair that her efforts were having no effect, she pushed the plant, but it did not bend. She hit it, but it did not break. Finally, she dug into it with her knife. It was hard, but it yielded its tough skin and some of the flesh inside, and a tiny amount of sticky water oozed out. The gardener tried to sing as she poured water into the wound, and while the words were the same as before, the melody was hardly discernible. As she left full of frustration, she unwittingly trod on some of the flowers to which she had once sung with the love, beauty, and truth of the heavens.\\n\\nThe weather grew colder, and the gardener\u2019s heart grew fainter as she pushed her wheelbarrow through the meadow with greater exhaustion each day. She felt terrible each time she accidentally stepped on or rolled over some of her flowers. In time she found it almost impossible to speak to them, and in her weariness she became unable to make it to some of them often enough to sustain them. And whether by that or by the growing cold, many plants began to die.\\n\\nOne day out in the meadow, a fierce storm blew in unexpectedly, and the gardener was far from shelter. Hail began to fall, and through limited visibility she barely saw a large tree nearby and ran to it, clinging to its trunk. Icy chunks hit the tree, which shielded her. She ran back for the wheelbarrow and propped it against the trunk and crouched in between the two. Wrapping her coat over her body, huddled at the base of the tree, she fell asleep in exhaustion and slept there for the night as the wind howled around her.\\n\\nIn the morning, the gardener awoke to a clear sky and branches and leaves littered on the ground around her and her tree. She was disheartened to look out and see many of the plants for which she had cared dashed to pieces by the storm, and she could not help but feel that she had failed them. Finally, turning around toward the tree, she thanked it for keeping her safe. She looked up into the tree and saw a haggard, damp raccoon huddled in a cleft. In a hole high in one of the main branches she saw a tiny bird peering out at her. And in the crevices and folds of the bark, innumerable ants, beetles, spiders, and locusts had found their refuge. While studying this tough outer covering of her tree, she saw a place where the bark had been stripped away, which had begun to decay, but was beginning to heal from the outside in. She walked around the trunk and soon saw the straight lacerations of a blade that had cut through the bark and into the sapwood, but this wound was still raw, though darkened by the elements. The gardener sobbed and clung to the tree.\\n\\nThe next day, the gardener returned to her tree, without water, wheelbarrow, or song. She simply sat underneath its branches quietly. She looked down at the ground and saw the roots crisscrossing above and below the surface of the soil, full of dirt, rocks, and decayed leaves, and imagined the roots extending deep into the earth, holding on with all their might, wrapping around boulders, stones, and themselves, and never letting go, and drinking deep the water of heaven and pulling it upward to its branches and leaves. She longed also to be held that tightly by her tree, and looking up into its limbs, she felt an excitement from her childhood return to her. She climbed the trunk and soon her hands and feet were moving with joy as she reached the highest branch that would support her. Settling into a nook, she let the tree hug her, and she sat for hours, looking out at the meadow and sky and feeling the gentle rock and sway of the tree as it moved in its own way in the breeze, as if dancing to the love, beauty, and truth of the heavens. Day after day, she returned to her tree, climbed its branches, and each day, she heard and relearned the songs of the love, beauty, and truth of the heavens... even new, deeper songs that made the old ones all the more beautiful.\\n\\nAs winter set in, the gardener longed to stay with her tree, so she brought a ladder and built a small house up in a sturdy branch, overhanging the meadow below. Its wooden shingles, plank floor, and the blankets she carried up gave her the warmth and the shelter to feel the sway and hear the breeze in the leaves and watch the bucks and the does wander and jump and run through the meadow. And when the snow fell gently, it insulated her small treehouse all the more, and a peace beyond her understanding returned to her that she had thought was gone.\\n\\nIn time, the snow melted, and the grasses began to green again. The weather warmed and sprouts emerged from the ground all throughout the meadow. The love, beauty, truth, peace, and joy of the heavens was everywhere and could not be silenced. The tree breathed and waved, and the gardener opened her mouth and the meadow heard the strong and clear songs of heaven, both old and new.\\n\\nThe next day the gardener brought her wheelbarrow and watering cans and took to her work once again. Some days the gentle rain was enough, and she brought only her songs, which the flowers also absorbed and thereby gained an extra splendor. She also sang to her tree\u2014which was by now again extending its leaves\u2014the love, beauty, and truth of the heavens. And she perceived that it, too, took in her songs as a familiar and ancient melody, made new again and closer than ever. After several more weeks, the gardener began to notice a change in the tree, as if it were preparing for something beautiful. But she continued to wander through the meadow, tending to her flowers with new and renewed love. One morning, she awoke in her treehouse and all around her on every branch were dazzling purple and white blossoms. Honey bees and hummingbirds visited and made her acquaintance. She climbed out of her treehouse and up again to the highest branch that would support her. She felt the sway of the branch in the breeze and heard the song of the wind through the leaves, and she lifted up her voice, and together they sang the love, beauty, and truth of the heavens."}]}')}}]);
